This plugin was created to help organise having lots of open tabs.
An issue I came across with SublimeCodeIntel and trying to get variables.

I primarily work in HTML/PHP, CSS/SCSS and JS so these are the default settings.

However the user preferences contain options for what files will be displayed in
which window and you are free to customise these.
